# Increase F&B service satisfaction rate
## PROBLEM STATEMENT

The challenge presented is to conduct a descriptive analysis that uncovers patterns within the F&B service data. Through this analysis, the focus will be on isolating key drivers of overall customer satisfaction. The subsequent goal is to translate these insights into actionable recommendations that not only alleviate customer pain points but also address potential challenges within the current F&B inventory planning. This approach will enable the company to streamline its F&B services, elevating the satisfaction of passengers and reinforcing its position as a premier airline provider.

## How is F&B Satisfaction Calculated?

F&B satisfaction is measured using our NPS (Net Promoter Score) survey. Customers are asked - How satisfied were they with the food & beverage served on theiw flight from [CITY1] to [CITY2]? Customers can score between 0-5 and can also provide additional feedback under - Was there anything else they would like to share about the food & beverage served on their flight from [CITY1] to [CITY2]?

<B> Inflight Satisfaction = Satisfied Sample/Total Sample * 100 </B>

Satisfied Sample = Score is either 4 or 5 (Score ranges from 0-5)
